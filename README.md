# Stevo's GenAI Blocklist

A filter list for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock?tab=readme-ov-file#ublock-origin-ubo) and [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-browser-extension/overview.html) that hides specific website features that use Generative AI or content labeled as AI generated.

## Optional extra blocklist
There is an additional optional filter list [`GenAI-Blocklist-Extra.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stevoisiak/Stevos-GenAI-Blocklist/refs/heads/main/GenAI-Blocklist-Extra.txt) with additional blocks. These are more subjective or experimental blocks. They may be more prone to accidentally blocking non-AI content or content required for site functionality. These include:
* Reddit: Content from AI-focused subreddits. (Main filter only hides post recommendations)
* X: Posts made by @Grok.
* AI category section on news sites (Just the category, not posts covering AI).
* Customer support chatbots that must be used before you can contact human customer support.
* YouTube: Trusted filter to remove autodubbing when loading video directly from URL, but causes visible page refresh even on videos without autodubbing.

## FAQ
### Which adblockers will this filter list work with?
These filters have been tested with [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/ublock#ublock-origin-ubo), [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-browser-extension/overview.html), [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/), [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/), and [Brave's](https://brave.com) integrated adblocker.

### Will this remove sites that post AI generated content from search results?
No. If you want to block AI sites from search engines, try [laylavish's Huge AI Blocklist](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist).

### Can I use these filters with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/)?
No. Pi-hole and uBlock Origin work differently. uBlock Origin allows filtering individual elements on pages, while Pi-hole blocks entire domains.

### Can I use these filters with [Opera](https://www.opera.com/)?
No. Opera's built-in adblocker doesn't allow importing custom filter lists via URL, and the filters have no effect when imported into uBlock Origin's extension for Opera. ([This may be an issue with Opera](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/issues/64))

### Why are AI Overviews still showing up on Google?
If you use AdBlock Plus, make sure "[Show acceptable ads](https://help.adblockplus.org/adblock-plus-help-center/what-are-acceptable-ads)" is [disabled in your settings](https://help.adblockplus.org/adblock-plus-help-center/block-all-ads).

### Why is AdGuard recommended for Google Chrome and iOS instead of uBlock Origin?
uBlock Origin is not available for Google Chrome and iOS.

While uBlock Origin Lite exists as an alternative, it [does not support custom filter lists](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/issues/167#issuecomment-2271471121). A previous version of this README suggested copying the GenAI filters into uBO Lite's custom filters as a workaround. However, filtering was unreliable, updating required [manually deleting the old filter rules](https://superuser.com/q/1934748/358766), and some filter rules were incompatible.

### Does this prevent AI content from being generated in the background?
Sometimes, but usually not.

These filters hide AI elements. In some cases this may stop the generation. For example, if you load [this Google Search page](https://www.google.com/search?q=SQL+What+percentage+of+users+have+accessed+a+group) with filters on, then toggle "cosmetic filtering" off in uBlock Origin, you can see the AI overview won't generate until after it gets unhidden. However, AI content may still be generated in the background on other webpages.

### How many websites have filters for AI features?
Over 200.

### Why do some filters show an error "*Invalid filter: Filter requires trusted source*"?
A small number of filters, (6 at the time of writing), use features that require trusted origin filters. Trusted filters are disabled by default in uBlock Origin for security reasons, as they allow directly executing code on webpages.

This list requires trust to:
* Replace "Search or ask a question" text on GitHub Docs and YouTube.
* Remove the "[AI sparkle](https://design.google/library/ai-sparkle-icon-research-pozos-schmidt)" from search icons on Gmail and Google's blog.
* Remove automatic audio dubbing on YouTube videos if they were directly loaded from a URL. (in Extra filters, [see below FAQ entry](https://github.com/Stevoisiak/Stevos-GenAI-Blocklist#why-do-youtube-videos-still-sometimes-play-ai-dubbed-audio-tracks)).

To be clear, ***you do not need to mark this list as trusted to use a majority of the AI filters***. However, if you want to use the filters listed above, you can go to [uBlock Origin's advanced settings](https://github.com/gorhill/ublock/wiki/Advanced-settings) and add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stevoisiak/Stevos-GenAI-Blocklist/refs/heads/main/` to [`trustedListPrefixes`](https://github.com/gorhill/ublock/wiki/Advanced-settings#trustedListPrefixes). Alternatively, if you use AdGuard there will be a "trusted" checkbox you can enable when importing the filter list.

### Why do YouTube videos still sometimes play AI dubbed audio tracks?
The filter for automatic dubbing on YouTube does not work when opening a video via direct URL. (IE: Entering the address directly in your browser's URL bar). It will work when clicking a video while already on YouTube, such as on YouTube's homepage, search results, or suggested videos.

The [extra filter list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stevoisiak/Stevos-GenAI-Blocklist/refs/heads/main/GenAI-Blocklist-Extra.txt) has a filter that works when loading directly from URL, but it requires allowing trusted filters to run, ([see above FAQ entry](https://github.com/Stevoisiak/Stevos-GenAI-Blocklist#why-do-some-filters-show-an-error-invalid-filter-filter-requires-trusted-source)), and causes a visible page refresh whenever a video is loaded directly via URL.
